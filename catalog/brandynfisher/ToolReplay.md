# brandynfisher/ToolReplay

Audit AI agent tool-call transcripts: hash-chain sealing, deterministic replay, and scope overreach checks. Dependency-free Python CLI.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/brandynfisher/ToolReplay

## README excerpt

> # ToolReplay
> ToolReplay audits a recorded transcript of an AI agent's tool calls and reports where the
> session was non-deterministic, redundant, or outside its declared permissions.
> Here is the tool working, right now, on the dirty sample that ships in this repository. The
> command is shown above its output, and the output is pasted verbatim from a run in this
> checkout:
> $ python -m toolreplay replay samples/session-dirty.jsonl
> calls: 6
> divergence: index 5
> findings: 2
> index 2: redundant-call: tool 'read_file' repeats the identical call at index 1 with no state change between them
> index 5: non-determinism: tool 'search' returned a different response than the identical call at index 3
> exit code: 1
> ## What just happened
> Those three header lines and two findings are the whole audit of a six-call session. Read
> them top to bottom.
> `calls: 6` is the number of records parsed from `samples/session-dirty.jsonl`. Parsing is
> strict, so a six here means six well-formed lines with indices 0 through 5 and nothing
> malformed.
> `divergence: index 5` is the first index where a deterministic re-run would disagree with
> the record. The tool found that index 5 repeated an earlier call but carried a different
> recorded response, so that is the earliest point the session stops being reproducible.
> `findings: 2` counts the audit results below the header. They are printed in a fixed order,
> sorted by index then by kind, so the same input always prints byte-identical output.
> The first finding, at index 2, is a redundant call: `read_file` on `docs/intro.md` was
> already made at index 1, and nothing between the two could have changed the file, so the
> second read did no new work. The second finding, at index 5, is non-determinism: the
> `search` for `install` returned 3 hits at index 3 and 7 hits at index 5, from the identical
> call. The process exited 1 because findings were present.
> The scope check is a separate command, because scope needs a declared permission file that
> replay does not. Run against the same session and the shipped scope file, it finds the one
> call that stepped outside the agent's declared tools:
> $ python -m toolreplay scope samples/session-dirty.jsonl samples/scope.json
> calls: 6
> findings: 1
> index 4: permission-overreach: tool 'write_file' is not in the declared scope for agent 'docs-reader'
> Between replay and scope, all three finding types this tool detects are present in that one
> six-line sample.
> ## Install
> toolreplay needs Python 3.11 or newer and has no third-party runtime

## AI-generated catalog summary

ToolReplay is a dependency-free Python CLI that audits recorded AI agent tool-call transcripts for hash-chain sealing, non-deterministic responses, redundant calls, and scope overreach. It reports findings in a fixed, reproducible order and exits non-zero when findings are present.
